## Monetization strategies

Ouro has two different pricing models that users can choose to monetize their assets with.

- **Pay-for-usage**: Users pay a variable-cost each time they use the asset, depending on how much usage they need. This is useful for assets that are used frequently and have an associated cost to maintain, like hardware resource time and energy.
- **Pay-to-unlock**: This model is a one-time fee that unlocks the asset for the user. This is useful for assets that are used infrequently, but are still valuable.

In general, Earth layer assets are Pay-to-unlock, Water and Fire are Pay-for-usage, and Air is a mixture of both. See the table below for more details.
