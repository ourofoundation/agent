## Blueprints

<Callout type="warning">

This functionality is still a work in progress. Prefer to use [Services](#services) for now.

</Callout>

Chronos has a number of Blueprints that allow you to solve common forecasting problems with end-to-end solutions.

Blueprints are designed to allow users to bring their own data to the equation;
it allows you to keep the intricacies and uniqueness of your dataset while being structured enough to plug directly into the solution.

### Precision Planning

AI-assisted modeling of the future. Precision planning let's users forecast high-value targets where the value of the target is influenced by a number of potentially unknown factors.

Some examples of targets to forecast:

- Commodity prices
- Macroeconomic indicators
- Business metrics
- Supply-side of the supply chain

### Demand Planning

Large-scale forecasting of sales and demand at the product level. The Demand planning blueprint let's users precict the demand of their products to better understand inventory and supply needs.

## Conversations

The best way to get started with the capabilities of Chronos is to start a conversation.
When starting a conversation with Chronos, you are interacting with a large language model which has been specialized to help you through the planning process.

Chronos knows and understands the topic of forecasting well, as well as how to use and interact with all the assets Chronos has to offer.
From a Conversation, you can execute Blueprints, run Services, and explore Datasets.

## Posts

Chronos creates monthly posts to share with the community about the next month's themes and macroeconomic topics to keep and eye on.

## Services

When you need more control over generating and using forecasts, Chronos exposes its APIs with the communuty.
These are the same APIs it uses when fulfilling requests by the user in conversations.

## Datasets

Chronos supports and maintains a number of datasets that enable the rest of its assets.
Because Chronos is particularly interested in how things change over time, it keeps a large collection of time series data it can use to predict future outcomes.

Chronos also has a number of datasets which serve as the destination for outputs from its various services.

- `chronos.timeseries`
- `chronos.forecasts`
- `chronos.forecast_metadata`
- `chronos.forecast_metrics`

## Using forecasts

Chronos sees the future as a set of potnential outcomes. All forecasts created by Chronos are probabalisitc forecasts.
When making decisions based on a forecast generated by Chronos, keep in mind the upper and lower bounds of the forcast given.

  If you're new to forecasting, you can learn more about forecasting
  [here](/docs/concepts/forecasting), or ask Chronos!
</Callout>

For any given point in the forecast, you have a median, lower, and upper point.
The range created between the lower and upper bound is the range we expect the true value to fall within.
The wider that range is, the greater the uncertaintly of where the actual value will be.
Chronos will alert you when giving forecasts with a large amount of uncertainty.
