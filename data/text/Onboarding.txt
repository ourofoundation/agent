## Accessing Ouro from other interfaces

While the web interface is a great way to get started with Ouro, there are other powerful ways to interact with the platform that may better suit your needs and workflow.
If you're a developer, data scientist, or integration specialist, you might want to leverage Ouro's capabilities programmatically or integrate Ouro into your existing systems and applications.

To enable seamless integration and programmatic access, Ouro provides a comprehensive Web API, as well as programming interfaces in popular languages like Python and JavaScript.
These interfaces allow you to authenticate as your Ouro account and interact with the platform's features and functionalities using familiar tools and frameworks.

### Generate an API key

To get started with these alternative interfaces, you'll need to generate an API key.
An API key is a unique identifier that allows you to authenticate your requests and securely access Ouro's API endpoints.
You can generate an API key from your [Settings](/app/settings/api-keys):

1. **Log in to your Ouro account**: Start by logging in to your Ouro account through the web interface.

2. **Navigate to the settings**: Once logged in, click on your profile avatar in the top-right corner of the screen and select "Settings" from the dropdown menu.

3. **Access the API keys tab**: In the settings menu, locate and click on the "API Keys" tab. This is where you'll manage your API keys.

4. **Generate a new API key**: Click on the "Create a key" button. Ouro will prompt you to provide a name or description for your API key. Choose a meaningful name that reflects the purpose or project you'll be using the key for.

5. **Copy and save the API key**: Once you've provided a name and confirmed the key generation, Ouro will display your newly created API key. Make sure to copy this key and store it securely.

With your API key in hand, you're ready to start interacting with Ouro programmatically.
Here are a few examples of what you can do:

- **Web API**: Use your API key to authenticate requests to Ouro's Web API endpoints. You can make HTTP requests to retrieve data, create and manage assets, execute services, and more. The Web API follows RESTful principles and supports JSON payloads, making it easy to integrate with various programming languages and frameworks.

- **Python Interface**: Ouro provides a Python package that wraps the Web API and offers a Pythonic way to interact with the platform. With the Python interface, you can leverage the power of Python's rich ecosystem to process data, build machine learning models, and create data-driven applications that integrate seamlessly with Ouro.

- **JavaScript Interface**: If you're working on web applications or Node.js projects, Ouro's JavaScript interface allows you to interact with the platform using familiar JavaScript syntax and conventions. You can easily make asynchronous requests, handle responses, and build dynamic and interactive applications that harness Ouro's capabilities.

To dive deeper into each of these interfaces and explore the available functionalities, make sure to check out the dedicated documentation:

- [Web API docs](/docs/developers/api)
- [Python docs](/docs/developers/client-libraries)
- [JavaScript docs](/docs/developers/client-libraries)

These resources provide detailed information on authentication, API endpoints, code examples, and best practices to help you get the most out of Ouro's programmatic interfaces.

By leveraging Ouro's API and programming interfaces, you can unlock a whole new level of possibilities and integrate Ouro's powerful features into your existing workflows and applications.
Whether you're automating data processing, building custom analytics tools, or creating innovative solutions, Ouro's flexible and extensible interfaces empower you to bring your ideas to life and achieve your goals more efficiently.
