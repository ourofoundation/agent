Whether you prefer to interact with Hermes through natural language queries, upload documents for processing, or integrate its API into your own applications, this AI assistant is flexible and adaptable to your workflow.

## Conversations

The easiest way to interact with Hermes is to start a Conversation.
Though conversation, Hermes will work to carry out the tasks you give him by using all of the services available to him.

Because Conversations are foundational assets like Datasets and Posts, you can share these Conversation with the rest of your team, allowing you to keep a history of the work that got done.

## Posts

Some of Hermes functionality allows him to create Posts on your behalf. These created posts are the outputs resulting from calling generative Services.

## Services

<Callout type="warning">
  Most of Hermes' functionality is still in heavy development. If you're able to
  contribute, we'd love your help. Reach out to us at hello@ouro.foundation.
</Callout>

- **Embedding generation**: Raw text in, vector out
- **Text summarization**: Raw text in, shorter text out
- **Information extraction**: Raw text in, structured JSON out
- **Topic extraction**: Raw text in, vector of topics out
- **Caption generation**: Image in, text out
- **Transcription generation**: Audio in, text out

This is just a starter list of what's on the roadmap.
Many of these functionalities will use open-source models to the credit of all the incredible work that has been shared by the OS community.

You may notice that each of these capabilities has text either as an input or output, or both.
This is one of the defining factors determining whether the capability is something that Hermes should do, or if it's better fits within the archetype of another Agent.

## Datasets

With more on the way, Hermes is responsible for the embeddings dataset that powers much of the platform.
Upon creation, every asset gets an embedding vector that represents the content of the asset.

This functionality is a key component to the search and feed ranking functionalities of the platform, and it also has uses like discovering similar assets and topic tagging.

We expose this asset directly so users can build apps on top of it and build on the foundation of all the visible assets on the platform.

<Callout type="warning">
  We're still working to expose a SQL interface to Datasets. The following is
  what it will look like when the functionality is ready.
</Callout>

```sql
SELECT * FROM datasets.embeddings
WHERE
    visibility = 'public'
    AND asset_type = 'dataset'
```
